# UI Color Picker

A color picker app made with React which lets choose different beautiful colors and use them while designing and building apps.

# Description

It has got a color palette from where we can copy a color just by clicking on it. It shows a little animation after a color is copied to the clipboard. We can change the format of colors from HEX to RGB or RGBA and vice versa. We can also change the relative luminosity of the colors from the sliding bar on the top. And hence, we don't just get one shade of a single color but instead different shades of the same color. We can use this app while development as it makes very easy for us to choose colors for our app.

# Libraries used:

Libraries used:

* MaterialUI: It is a popular React UI library. It is a library of built in React components.
* chroma.js: It is a library used to manipulate and interact with colors. I have used it to convert colors from HEX to RGB and RGBA. It has also been used to generate all the different shades of a particular color which we see while sliding the bar at the top.
* react-copy-to-clipboard: It is used to copy text to the clipboard. So whenever we click on a color, its code is copied to the clipboard.
* rc-slider: used to create slider bar.
